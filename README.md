# Digital_Twin_Productivity
Colab notebook and code for MSc thesis: Digital Twin Models for Remote Employee Productivity — human-centered framework using ML to analyse productivity &amp; well-being in hybrid work.

# Digital Twin – Remote/Hybrid Productivity (MSc Thesis)

This repository contains the Colab notebook used in my MSc thesis:
**Digital Twin Models for Remote Employee Productivity in Hybrid Work Environments.**
 to model and simulate productivity under hybrid/remote work.

## Files
- `Digital_Twin_Productivity.ipynb` — step-wise notebook (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting + simulations)

## Dataset
The dataset is **Remote Work Productivity** from Kaggle.  
Download it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/remote-work-productivity  
Save it as `remote_work_productivity.csv` and upload it into the Colab runtime.

## Run (Colab)
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload  the dataset CSV (`remote_work_productivity.csv`) when prompted to the runtime.
3. Run all cells top-to-bottom step-by-step

## Reproducibility
Random seeds are set; the notebook prints metrics and simulation results reported in the thesis.
